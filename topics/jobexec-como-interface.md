# Using SAS Job Execution as an Interface

The SAS Job Execution Web Application also allows you to build interactive web interfaces that connect directly to your SAS code ‚Äî all using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This approach turns SAS into a true application platform, offering a customized visual experience for the end user.

## üåê File Organization

When creating an interface in the SAS Job Execution Web Application, follow this file structure logic:

- **Main HTML**: defines the screen layout (visual elements, iframes, buttons, etc.)
- **Inline CSS and JS (initially)**: ideal for quick testing and development
- **Final version**: move CSS and JS to separate files (text-based Jobs), and reference them via URI

This incremental approach encourages version control, code reuse, and easier maintenance.

## üìé Referencing Static Files

For security reasons, **SAS Viya 3.5** does not allow connections to external resources via CDN. This includes libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Fonts, icons, images, etc. To work around this:

- Download the files locally
- Upload them using **SAS Drive** (mandatory)
- Copy the file‚Äôs URI link (tutorial coming soon)
- Use that link in your HTML (`src` or `href`), appending `/content` at the end of the URL

Example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/files/1234abcd-9876-.../content">
<script src="/files/files/5627257a-73bc-4f06-936.../content"></script>
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This applies to images (JPG, PNG, SVG), fonts, icons (.ico), and any other static resources.

## üñºÔ∏è Dynamic Content via iframe

Using iframes is recommended to load internal content such as Visual Analytics reports, dashboards, or even other HTML jobs.

Basic example:

```html
<iframe
  id="contentFrame"
  name="contentFrame"
  src="https://meu-servidor/SASVisualAnalytics/?reportUri=/reports/path&appSwitcherDisabled=true"
  scrolling="no"
  frameborder="0"
  >
</iframe>
```

- The **`&appSwitcherDisabled=true`** parameter is mandatory. It prevents VA from redirecting the user to the application selection screen. Without this parameter, the `report` link will not work[^1].
- You can use multiple iframes on a single page, each with a chart, report, or other VA content.

## üß† Best Practices

- Use visual styles based on the branding colors of the project you‚Äôre working on.
- Name your elements with logic and clarity (e.g., `id="spending-chart"`, `class="green-button"`)
- Prefer vanilla JS instead of frameworks, since it's not possible to import external libraries via CDN
- Create a dedicated folder or job structure specifically for your HTML, CSS, and JS files to simplify future maintenance
