## Objective

This repository gathers the essential materials to help you build robust and efficient applications using **SAS Job Execution**.

The main goal is to demonstrate how to fully leverage the power of this tool to create **APIs, interactive interfaces, and analytical workflows** ‚Äî expanding its use beyond traditional practices.

## Usage Rules

[View the SAS Job Execution rules and prerequisites](/RULES.md) for building applications with SAS Job Execution.

## Required Skills and Tools

To follow along with this repository, it is recommended that you have familiarity with:

‚úÖ **SAS Viya** and **SAS Job Execution**<br>
‚úÖ **SAS programming logic** for process automation<br>
‚úÖ **REST APIs** for data consumption and integration<br>
‚úÖ **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** for building interactive interfaces

## How Can SAS Job Execution Be Used?

### [Using Job Execution as a Workflow](/topicos/jobexec-como-fluxo.md)

Automate **complex analytical processes** by connecting multiple tasks and ensuring sequential or parallel execution of SAS scripts. This approach facilitates data flow orchestration and enhances operational efficiency.

### [Using Job Execution as an API](/topicos/jobexec-como-api.md)

Turn your processes into **integrable services**, allowing other applications to consume and interact with your SAS workflows. This enables automated analyses, dynamic report generation, and integration with other systems.

### [Using Job Execution as an Interface](/topicos/jobexec-como-interface.md)

Build **custom, interactive, and intelligent interfaces** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** within JES. This allows the creation of dashboards, interactive forms, and tailored applications for data manipulation directly within the SAS platform.
